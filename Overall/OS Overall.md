# OS OVERALL



# OVERALL

If you look at OS like Ubuntu, Fedora, Suse or Centos – they all consist of two things:
  - OS Kernel 
  - set of software. 
  
The **OS Kernel** is responsible for interacting with the underlying hardware. 

While the *OS kernel* remains the same (*Linux* in this case), it’s the *software* above it that make these OS different. 

This **software** may consist of a different:
  - User Interface
  - drivers
  - compilers
  - File managers
  - developer tools
  - etc. 
  
SO you have a common *Linux Kernel* shared across all OSes and some *custom softwares* that differentiate OS from each other.
